/*
Write a C program that reads the first letter of direction (North, South, East, West), current (x,y) coordinate, and 
advancement of a person and prints the new coordinate. For e.g., if the current coordinate of a person in X- Y plane is (2,3) and
 s/he advances 6 units towards North, then his/her new coordinate is (2,3+6)=(2,9). 
Sample input/output (bold ones are user inputs):

Enter current coordinate (x and y positions): 2 3
Enter No. units towards direction: 6
Enter Direction: N
New coordinate: (2,9)
